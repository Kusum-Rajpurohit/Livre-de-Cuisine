    "GELATO\n\nIngredients\n4 medium egg yolks\n150 g (3/4 cup) of granulated sugar\n350 ml (1 ½ cup) of whole milk\n250 ml (1 cup) of heavy cream\nA little grated lemon zest or vanilla extract (optional)\n\nStep 1: Whip the egg yolks with the sugar at maximum speed for about 5 minutes, until you have a soft fluffy cream. You can use a stand mixer or an electric hand mixer. You can even beat them by hand with a whisk, but you need more time and the result is not as perfect as with the electric mixer.\n\nStep 2:Meanwhile, pour the milk in a saucepan and bring it almost to a boil. Cook for about 5 minutes.\nTHE MILK MUST NOT BOIL.\n\nStep 3: At this step, transfer the egg and sugar fluffy cream to a saucepan. Pour the hot milk slowly. Keep mixing while you do it. In this way you are pasteurizing the eggs. With the exception of flour, the procedure is similar to that of Pastry Cream recipe. If you want to flavor your gelato, this is the time to add either grated lemon zest or two drops of vanilla extract or vanilla bean. Now put it back on the heat and cook for another 5 minutes.\nWITHOUT BOILING AND ALWAYS STIRRING.\nhen turn off the heat and add the cold heavy cream. Mix really well. Now you have a lukewarm mixture. If you have an ice cream maker with a compressor (that cools while churning the gelato), there is no need to cool the mixture further in the refrigerator.\n\nStep 4: Now if you have an ice cream maker, pour the mixture into the machine and start it. It will take about 40 minutes, depending on the model. After the necessary time, your gelato is ready! Fresh, creamy and nutritious.\n\nPLEASE NOTE: The best ice cream maker you can find on the market is the one with a compressor that cools while churning the gelato. This ice cream maker is very similar to the professional ones and is the one we used for this recipe.\nStorage:\nOne of the reasons authentic Italian gelato tastes so good is because it’s fresh. So make gelato and eat it right away. If you leave it in the freezer for too long, crunchy ice crystals form and your gelato is no longer so good. So eat your homemade gelato immediately or within two days of making it.\n\nTip: if your gelato is too hard and frozen, let it thaw in the refrigerator for 10-15 minutes before serving.\n\nNutritional Facts\nCalories: 160.\nFat: 14.2g.\nSodium: 54mg.\nCarbohydrates: 19.5g.\nSugars: 17g.\nProtein: 3g.\nCalcium: 103mg (10% RDI)\n",

If desired, top with whipped cream and chocolate shavings.
